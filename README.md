# Deis Store

A backing store built on [Ceph](http://ceph.com) for use in the [Deis](http://deis.io) open
source PaaS.

The bin/boot scripts and Dockerfiles were inspired by
Seán C. McCord's [docker-ceph](https://github.com/Ulexus/docker-ceph) repository.

This Docker image is based on the official
[alpine:3.1](https://registry.hub.docker.com/_/alpine/) image.

Please add any issues you find with this software to the
[Deis project](https://github.com/deis/deis/issues).

## Containers

The store component is comprised of four containers:

* [store-daemon](https://index.docker.io/u/deis/store-daemon/) - the daemon which serves data
(in Ceph, this is an object store daemon, or OSD)
* [store-gateway](https://index.docker.io/u/deis/store-gateway/) - the blob store gateway,
offering Swift and S3-compatible bucket APIs
* [store-metadata](https://index.docker.io/u/deis/store-metadata/) - the metadata service necessary
to use the CephFS shared filesystem (in Ceph, this is a metadata server daemon, or MDS)
* [store-monitor](https://index.docker.io/u/deis/store-monitor/) - the service responsible for
keeping track of the cluster state (this is also called a monitor in Ceph)

These are all based upon the [store-base](https://github.com/deis/deis/tree/master/store/base) image,
which is a Docker container that preinstalls Ceph.

## Usage
